# GitHub-for-gemini-demo

This project is a demo designed to showcase how Gemini responds to interactions within a GitHub repository. Specifically, it demonstrates Gemini's ability to process and respond to content in issues and comments, often triggered by specific commands like `/gemini`.

We are looking for issue posters to interact with the demo, rather than code contributors at this time.
